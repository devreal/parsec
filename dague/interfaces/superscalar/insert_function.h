    **  Details of Flags **

 *  INPUT:          Data is used in read-only mode, no modification is done.
 *  OUTPUT:         Data is used in write-only, written only, not read.
 *  INOUT:          Data is read and written both.
 *  ATOMIC_WRITE:   Data is used like OUTPUT but the ordering of the tasks having this flag is not maintained
                    by the scheduler.
                    It is the responsibility of the user to make sure data is written atomically.
                    Treated like INPUT by the scheduler.
 *  SCRATCH:        Will be used by the task as scratch pad, does not effect the DAG, tells the runtime
                    to allocate memory specified by the user.
 *  VALUE:          Tells the runtime to copy the value as a parameter of the task.
